## ⚠️ What CANNOT Be Verified (Requires Flutter)

### 1. Code Generation Status ❓ NEEDS TO BE RUN

The following files need to be generated by running `flutter pub run build_runner build`:

**Freezed Files** (need generation):
- `lib/features/game/domain/entities/card.freezed.dart`
- `lib/features/game/domain/entities/card.g.dart`
- `lib/features/auth/domain/entities/user.freezed.dart`
- `lib/features/auth/domain/entities/user.g.dart`
- `lib/features/auth/data/models/auth_response.freezed.dart`
- `lib/features/auth/data/models/auth_response.g.dart`
- `lib/features/game/domain/entities/game.freezed.dart`
- `lib/features/game/domain/entities/game.g.dart`

**Injectable Files** (need generation):
- `lib/core/di/injection_container.config.dart`

**Test Mock Files** (need generation):
- `test/helpers/test_helper.mocks.dart`

**Without these generated files, the app WILL NOT compile!**

### 2. Compilation Status ❓ UNKNOWN

Cannot verify:
- Type errors
- Missing imports
- API compatibility
- Null safety issues
- Widget compatibility
- Platform-specific issues

### 3. Test Status ❓ UNKNOWN

Cannot verify:
- Unit tests pass
- Widget tests pass
- Integration tests pass
- Code coverage

### 4. Build Status ❓ UNKNOWN

Cannot verify:
- Android APK builds
- iOS IPA builds
- Release builds work
- Debug builds work

## 📝 Manual Verification Checklist

You MUST run these commands on your local machine with Flutter installed:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd belote_mobile
flutter pub get
```
**Expected Result**: All packages downloaded successfully

### Step 2: Run Code Generation ⚠️ CRITICAL
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
**Expected Result**:
- 9 files generated (.freezed.dart, .g.dart)
- `injection_container.config.dart` created
- No errors

**Common Issues**:
- If it fails, try: `flutter pub run build_runner clean` first
- Check Flutter SDK version is 3.16+
- Check Dart SDK version is 3.2+

### Step 3: Analyze Code
```bash
flutter analyze
```
**Expected Result**:
- No issues found
- Or only minor warnings (not errors)

**If Errors Occur**:
- Read error messages carefully
- Most common: missing generated files (run step 2 again)
- Import errors (check relative paths)
- Version conflicts (update Flutter/packages)

### Step 4: Run Tests
```bash
flutter test
```
**Expected Result**:
- All 3 tests pass:
  - `test/core/theme/app_theme_test.dart`
  - `test/features/auth/domain/entities/user_test.dart`
  - `test/widget_test.dart` (default Flutter test)

**Note**: Some tests may fail if code generation didn't run

### Step 5: Run the App
```bash
# On Android emulator
flutter run

# On iOS simulator
flutter run

# On Chrome (web)
flutter run -d chrome
```
**Expected Result**:
- App compiles successfully
- App starts and shows splash screen
- Can navigate between placeholder pages
- No runtime errors in console

### Step 6: Build for Production
```bash
# Android APK
flutter build apk --release

# Check build output
ls build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/
```
**Expected Result**:
- `app-release.apk` created
- Size should be reasonable (~20-50MB)
- No build errors

## 🔍 Known Potential Issues

### 1. Dependency Version Conflicts

The `pubspec.yaml` uses specific versions. If you have a different Flutter SDK version, you might need to update package versions:

```bash
flutter pub upgrade
```

### 2. Freezed/JSON Serialization

If you see errors like:
```
Error: The getter 'copyWith' isn't defined for the class 'UserEntity'
```

**Solution**: Run code generation:
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### 3. Injectable Dependency Injection

If you see errors like:
```
Error: Method not found: 'GetIt.init'
```

**Solution**: Run code generation to create `injection_container.config.dart`

### 4. Missing Assets

The app references assets in:
- `assets/images/`
- `assets/icons/`
- `assets/sounds/`
- `assets/cards/`
- `assets/fonts/`

These directories exist but are empty. The app will run, but:
- Images won't load (will show error widgets)
- Fonts will fall back to system defaults
- This is expected for Phase 0/1

### 5. API Endpoint

The default API URL is `http://localhost:3000`. To change it:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=BASE_URL=https://your-api-url.com
```

## ✅ What Should Work

Based on the code structure:

1. ✅ **App Should Compile** - After code generation
2. ✅ **App Should Run** - Shows splash screen and placeholder pages
3. ✅ **Navigation Should Work** - Can navigate between routes
4. ✅ **Theme Should Work** - Light/dark mode based on system
5. ✅ **Tests Should Pass** - Unit tests for User and Theme
6. ✅ **Build Should Succeed** - Can create release APK/IPA

## ❌ What Will NOT Work Yet

These require later phases to be implemented:

1. ❌ **Authentication** - UI not implemented (Phase 2)
2. ❌ **API Calls** - Repository implementations missing (Phase 2+)
3. ❌ **Game Logic** - UI and logic not implemented (Phase 4-6)
4. ❌ **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket not connected (Phase 5)
5. ❌ **Card Graphics** - Assets not provided
6. ❌ **Actual Gameplay** - Requires Phases 3-6

## 📊 Confidence Level

Based on static analysis:

- **Structure**: ✅ 100% - Follows Clean Architecture
- **Syntax**: ✅ 95% - No obvious errors visible
- **Dependencies**: ✅ 100% - All properly configured
- **Compilation**: ❓ 90% - Should compile after code generation
- **Tests**: ❓ 85% - Should pass after code generation
- **Runtime**: ❓ 90% - Should run with placeholder screens
- **Build**: ❓ 85% - Should build for Android/iOS

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run the verification steps above** on your local machine
2. **Report any errors** you encounter
3. **If everything passes**, proceed to Phase 2 implementation
4. **If errors occur**, check the troubleshooting section in README.md
